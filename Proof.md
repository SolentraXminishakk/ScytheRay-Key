The reason why you are flagged countless times by windows saying its a virus its not. Ill give you the long explaniation here so grab some popcorn.

1 Reason on why Windows flags it and the most common reason is because it changes a program (Roblox) and it could harm files/data inside of the actual game so it flags it for safety. We also dont do this and if u get errors like wactac you can find people who also get errors like this, Example: Reddit.

2nd Reason on why windows flags it is because they are false positives. The program injects dlls with all the code/scripts you need. The reason why it flags it is because if that code is malicious it could kill ur game or potentianlly harm youre computer. I have no malicious code added. You can check the source code if im lying.

3rd Reason on why windows flags it is because we are not verified by windows. (Aka not a real windows app) and we dont even have to do anything to prove we are innocent on this question.

4th and final reason this gets flagged is because its from indie coders from random places and if you were windows you would also probably think thats dangerous since youre only goal is to protect and serve the user.

Hope this helped yall (;
